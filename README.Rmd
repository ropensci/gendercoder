The goal of gendercoder is to allow simple re-coding of free-text gender 
responses. This is intended to permit representation of gender diversity, 
while managing troll-responses and the workload implications of manual coding. 

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN. To use this package please run the following code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/gendercoder")
library(gendercoder)
```
## Basic use

The gendercoder package permits the efficient re-coding of free-text gender 
responses within a tidyverse pipeline. It contains two in-built English output 
dictionaries, a default `broad_en` dictionary which corrects spelling and 
standardises terms while maintaining the diversity of responses and a 
`narrow_en` dictionary which contains fewer gender categories, "man", "woman", 
"boy", "girl", and "sex and gender diverse". 

The core function, `gender_recode()`, takes 3 arguments, 

- `gender` the vector of free-text gender,

- `dictionary` the preferred dictionary, and

- `retain_unmatched` a logical indicating whether original values should be carried over if 
there is no match. 

Basic usage is demonstrated below. 

```{r}
library(gendercoder)

tibble(gender = c("male", "MALE", "mle", "I am male", "femail", "female", "enby")) %>% 
  mutate(broad_gender  = recode_gender(gender, dictionary = broad_en, retain_unmatched = TRUE),
         narrow_gender = recode_gender(gender, dictionary = narrow_en, retain_unmatched = FALSE)
  )
  
```

The package now also contains a shiny app for use of the `gender_recode()` function by GUI. The app takes data in `.dta`, `.csv`, and `.sav` formats.

To use the app, call the `gendercoder_app()` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gendercoder::gendercoder_app()
```

## Contributing to this package

This package is a reflection of cultural context of the package contributors; we 
welcome issues and pull requests to make the package more inclusive and/or 
suitable for a broader range of cultural contexts. We particularly welcome 
addition of non-English dictionaries or of other gender-diverse responses to the 
broad and narrow dictionaries.
